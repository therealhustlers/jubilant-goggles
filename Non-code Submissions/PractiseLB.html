                    Social Media is a collective term for <br>
                    Websites and Applications that focus on communication, <br>
                    community-based input, interaction, content-sharing and <br>
                    collaborations. People use it to interact and stay in <br>
                    touch with friends, family and internet interactions <br>

                    Choose your favourite Social Media Platform... <br><br>
                    Instagram allows you to share your ideas, pictures, <br>
                    and many such things on your account, in public <br>
                    or to your family. <br><br>
                    On the other hand, Facebook, which was meant for Mark Zukerberg <br>
                    and his friends to interact, gained world wide popularity<br>
                    amongst people of all age groups. Here you can share your thoughts<br>
                    in public and gain followership.<br><br>
                    LinkedIn is kind of different.<br>
                    It is simply the "Instagram" for professionals.<br>
                    LinkedIn is meant for professionals to share their profiles to<br>
                    hirers.<br><br>
                    Omegle is completely different, where people get to meet and interact<br>
                    with strangers over Video Calls without knowing their Identity.<br>
                    But wait, BEWARE OF DOGS AND BITCHES on Omegle..... IYKYK

            <p class="conclusion">
                Overall we can conclude that Social Media can be <br>
                a better way to interact for those who feel shy <br>
                and introverts who aren't able to talk to people in-person.<br>
                Everything has a Positive as well as a Negative side.<br>
                If used in a correct way, it can give you many benefits.<br>
